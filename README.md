# Problem 1
The fibonacci function is implemented using Dynamic Programming. This function is a recursive function that uses the concept of Dynamic Programming by checking if the result is already calculated or not and if it is not, it calculates it and saves it so the next time the same calculation is needed it can use the saved value.

# Problem 2
In 'Problem 2' folder the question is solved in three different ways: 

1. Recursive function
Recursive function is simple to write and understand, but can be very slow and use a lot of memory for large input values of n due to the repeated function calls.

2. Iterative function using a loop
Iterative function using a loop is more efficient than the recursive function, as it avoids the overhead of repeated function calls, but it uses a few extra variables to store the previous values.

3. Iterative function using an array
Iterative function using an array is also more efficient than the recursive function, but it requires additional memory to store all the values of the sequence. However, it can be useful if you want to access the values of the sequence later on.
