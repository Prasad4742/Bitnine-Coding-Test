# Problem 1
(Copy the code from the Problem1 file and paste it to c++ compiler and run, there is no need of modification)
The first function F(int n) gives n^th fibonacci number as output.
The second function begins by creating a new node for the addition operation with the data fields set to 10 and 6.
The next one is multiplication operation, with the data fields set to 5 and 4. 
afterthat, another new node for the subtraction operation, having data fields with the results of the addition and multiplication operations.

To access the integer values directly from node: int value = node->data; is used.



# Problem 2
In 'Problem 2' folder the question is solved in three different ways: 

1. Recursive function
Recursive function is simple to write and understand, but can be very slow and use a lot of memory for large input values of n due to the repeated function calls.

2. Iterative function using a loop
Iterative function using a loop is more efficient than the recursive function, as it avoids the overhead of repeated function calls, but it uses a few extra variables to store the previous values.

3. Iterative function using an array
Iterative function using an array is also more efficient than the recursive function, but it requires additional memory to store all the values of the sequence. However, it can be useful if you want to access the values of the sequence later on.
