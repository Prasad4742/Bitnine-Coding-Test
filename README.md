In 'Problem 2' folder the question is solved in three different ways 1.Recursive function 2.Iterative function using a loop 3.Iterative function using an array

Recursive function is simple to write and understand, but can be very slow and use a lot of memory for large input values of n due to the repeated function calls.

Iterative function using a loop is more efficient than the recursive function, as it avoids the overhead of repeated function calls, but it uses a few extra variables to store the previous values.

Iterative function using an array is also more efficient than the recursive function, but it requires additional memory to store all the values of the sequence. However, it can be useful if you want to access the values of the sequence later on.
